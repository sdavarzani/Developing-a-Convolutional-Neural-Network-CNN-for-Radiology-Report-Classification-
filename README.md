# Developing-a-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-for-Radiology-Text-Report-Classification-
This project attempts to use Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Chest X-ray images into the healthy and pneumonia cases.

Datasets include X-Ray images of patients with pneumonia in comparison with X-Ray images of healthy patients.

The following information is provided regarding this dataset:

- A total of 5863 images are included in the dataset (5216 for training, 624 for testing, and 16 for validation)
- There are two classes: normal and pneumonia
- There are differences in the resolutions of the image samples.
